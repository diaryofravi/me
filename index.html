    <p>
      I grew up in Divar, Goa, also called Devwadi, surrounded by nature, quiet lanes, and the sea.
      Not the Goa you see in movies with crowds and chaos, or the one famous among people for real estate, but a serene, peaceful place closer to nature. Those early years taught me to enjoy life’s simple moments, like watching sunsets on the beach, getting wet in the rain, and finding peace in the small things around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I live in Bengaluru and work as a Network Engineer. My job has shaped me into someone who stays calm, thinks clearly, and solves problems with patience and intention. It has also strengthened my values of discipline, focus, and steady growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m an introvert who prefers minimalism and quiet spaces. I enjoy long walks, cooking something simple, riding my motorcycle, or listening to music after a long day. I also like learning about nutrition and staying active whether it’s a long walk, a home workout, or meditation to keep myself physically, mentally, and spiritually balanced. I love long drives too.
      These small routines keep me grounded.
    </p>

    <p>This space is where I share what matters to me: balance, simplicity, and the journey of becoming a better version of myself.</p>
