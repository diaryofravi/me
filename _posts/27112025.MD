# Craving Walnut Banana Cake #

*Ever since I quit white sugar since November 2024, I get this cravings of eating the Banana Walnut cake.
I found a cake on zomato which prepares the Banana walnut cake just the way i like it! I mean, they do not use Sugar or any artifical flavours or maida for baking.

Its a pure veg cake with heavenly taste :) 
It has some choco chips sprinkled on top, not a fan of it but yes,it looks great when pictures are taken!.*
