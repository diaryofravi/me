    <p>
      I grew up in Goa, surrounded by nature, quiet lanes, and the sea. Those early years taught me to enjoy life’s simple moments—watching sunsets on the beach, getting wet in the rain, and finding peace in the small things around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I live in Bengaluru and work as a Network Engineer. My job has shaped me into someone who stays calm, thinks clearly, and solves problems with patience and intention. It has also strengthened my values of discipline, focus, and steady growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m an introvert who prefers minimalism and quiet spaces. I enjoy long walks, cooking something simple, riding my motorcycle, or listening to music after a long day. These small routines keep me grounded.
    </p>

    <p>Nature and spirituality guide me deeply. I’m a devotee of Shiva, but I don’t believe in show-off—only in living with honesty, respect, and intention.</p>
    <p>This space is where I share what matters to me: balance, simplicity, and the journey of becoming a better version of myself.</p>
